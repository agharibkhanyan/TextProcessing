# TextProcessing

This is a text processing program written in python.
It takes in any .txt document and parses through the text tokenizing it.

A real search engine will do stopping and stemming to make the tokens more useful.
This code does not do such a thing.
We simply just take in character by character from the stream and feed it to our token list.

In the end, we get a result showing the number of tokens and in the document with their equivalent frequencies.

PartB takes in two text files and shows how many words intersect.
